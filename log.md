# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: August 1, 2022
### "Back in July I started coding"

I began my coding journey some months ago, I believe it was February 2022, I didn't make much progress after taking obssessively detailed notes on...*checks notes* an overview of modern web technologies... At any rate I brushed up on those and began taking more July, 13, 2022. Topics under the "Learn" section on developer.mozilla.org are informative but I felt the need to follow each "recommended reading" link and end up up with a bunch of tabs open. July 17 I learned more about Project Goals and Ideation.
- July 18: Learned the basics of how the internet works from this Aaron Titus video.
- July 19: The difference between a website, web page, web server, and search engine. 
- July 21-30: Lessons 1 and 2 and half of 3 in freecodecamp.org's Responsive Web Design Certification. Tried to make HTML and CSS cheat sheets while going though the course, quickly lost steam multiple times but still managed to retain most of what I was learning.
- July 31: Decided how to better take notes and structure them and their storage.<br>
#### **To Do:**<br>
1. Finish/continue mozilla notes.
2. Move onto freecodecamp's modules
3. Retake Lesson 2 (freecodecamp), make notes for cheat sheet
4. Codecademy or Mimo? Notes?<br>
#### **Project Idea:**<br>
Time Princess Selfie Website
- August 1: Began Codecademy's Learn HTML Course, Lesson 1 (?)

<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)-->
